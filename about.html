		<h2>Why I Chose Saint Petersburg for This Project</h2>
        <p>My name is Rustam Aminev. I studied in Saint Petersburg for 5 years and lived there for 10 years. This city is very special to me.</p>
        <p>I chose Saint Petersburg for this project because of its incredible architecture, culture, and personal memories I have from living there. Itâ€™s a place that combines beauty and history in a unique way.</p>
